# nosql-challenge

This repository contains the files for challenge 12-- noSQL challenge using mongoDB. 

For this challenge I worked directly within the starter Jupyter Notebooks provided. They can be found in the 'Starter_Code_3' folder. 

In summary: 

First the json file was imported to mongo via terminal. In the noSQL_setup_starter.ipynb notebook the uk_food database and establishments collection were set up. The database was then updated as per instruction, noted through the comments. 

The second notebook noSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb contains the exploritory analysis for this assignment. Through this we find the top 5 establishments
nearest to Penang Flavours. In addition we find how many restaurants in each local authority have a hygiene score of 0. 

Thanks for viewing!
